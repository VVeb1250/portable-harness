## Verdict on backend — keep ICM

ICM is the right **struct** (verified): `topic·scope·importance·weight·access_count·
summary·raw_excerpt·keywords·embedding·related_ids`. Primitives map cleanly onto
the Mem0 model (ADD=`store`, UPDATE=`update`, DELETE=`forget`, NOOP=skip,
merge=`consolidate`). Semantic out-of-box (MiniLM), CLI = 0 def-tax, cross-host
via one SQLite + `icm.exe` on both hosts.

**agentmemory (rohitg00 / `@agentmemory/agentmemory`)** — strongest challenger
seen. Higher ceiling (95.2% R@5 LongMemEval-S), built-in 12-hook auto-capture +
LLM-compress, 1423 tests, 24k★. **Not adopted**: daemon-centric (iii-engine +
ports 3111/3113/49134, no one-shot CLI recall) conflicts with the lean/portable/
stateless thesis. The one thing it buys — auto-capture — is cheaply rebuildable
on ICM. *Recheck trigger:* shift to **multi-agent team** (concurrent shared live
memory) → its server model wins; or ICM rebuild proves low-quality; or we want
its observability (session replay/OTel/viewer). The old ledger note
("bm25-only") is **stale** — it now ships local MiniLM + hybrid RRF.

## Memory-type model (CoALA) + consolidation pathway

```
EPISODIC ──reflection(distill)──► SEMANTIC ──recurrence, human-gated──► PROCEDURAL
buffer / blackboard               ICM (experiential)                    skills (router)
                                  AGENTS.md family (committed)
```
- **Episodic** (raw: pending candidates, coordination) — transient.
- **Semantic** (distilled lessons/facts) = the **wiki**. Split:
  - experiential / cross-project / decay-prone → **ICM**
  - convention / ADR / architecture (repo-worthy, reviewable) → **CLAUDE.md /
    AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md** (linker injects all three)
- **Procedural** (runbook/recipe) = **skills** — already cross-host (router scans
  `.claude`+`.codex`+`.agents`). Recurring lessons *graduate* here (human-gated).

## Locked decisions

1. **ICM = the only true cross-host store** — semantic wiki + `pending` topic
   (never recalled into wiki) + blackboard coordination/continuity.
2. **Scope narrow** — experiential→ICM; committed→AGENTS.md family. **Storage
   split, recall unified** (recall reads ICM **and** greps the host context file).
3. **Continuity → ICM blackboard handoff** (retire CC-file's cross-host role;
   resume works on any host). CC file-memory = optional CC-only scratch, *outside*
   this design.
4. **Graduation = suggest** (human-gated; only procedural-shaped lessons; never
   auto-write a skill from an unvalidated lesson — skills are higher authority).
5. **Cross-link = defer traversal, populate `related_ids`** opportunistically
   during curation (data ready if graph is added later; flat recall is the 80%).
6. **Reflection engine — heuristic default, LLM as an optional silent-bug pass
   (hybrid).** *Updated by Phase-4 bench (`bench/_reflection_ab.py`), superseding
   the original "host-uniform dedicated DeepSeek" call.* On the gold set both
   arms scored F1≈0.86, but the heuristic is free/instant (0.16ms, $0) while
   DeepSeek costs ~2.1s + ~$0.00025/session and only **shifts** the error profile
   (catches silent bugs the `is_error` heuristic is blind to, but drops terse user
   corrections). So: keep the heuristic as the always-on capture, add a dedicated
   LLM (DeepSeek, host-uniform — avoids the nested-`claude` footgun) ONLY as a
   second pass for the silent-bug class. Re-bench with more fixtures before lock.
7. **CLI floor before hook** — `paw recall` / `paw reflect` work on any host
   (pull); push (UserPromptSubmit) + capture (Stop) hooks are enhancements on
   hook-capable hosts (CC, Codex). Other (API-call) hosts: deferred, CLI-only.

## Wiki entry schema (ICM)

```
topic:       mistakes | lessons | facts
importance:  low|medium|high|critical   (escalates on recurrence)
keywords:    [terms…, seen:N, type:execution|silent-bug|misalignment]
summary:     distilled trigger→fix / lesson (atomic, retrieval-phrased)
related_ids: [linked lessons/mistakes]   scope: project|global
```

### Mistake taxonomy (drives multi-signal capture)
| type | capture signal | reliability |
|---|---|---|
| **execution / AI oversight** | tool `is_error`, error→success sequence | heuristic ✓ |
| **silent bug (no error)** | none in-session; later test-fail/revert, or explicit | cross-session / explicit only |
| **user↔AI misalignment** | user correction/rework markers, dissatisfaction | heuristic partial |

Capture emits **coarse candidates + provisional type**; the reflection step
classifies + extracts the real lesson + discards false positives.

## Honest host tiers (degrade gracefully)

| host | capture (Stop) | recall push | recall pull (CLI) | reflect | committed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | hook ✓ (`transcript_path`, JSONL) | paw_block ✓ | `paw recall` | dedicated/live | CLAUDE.md |
| Codex | hook ✓ (format TBV) | paw_block ✓ | `paw recall` | dedicated | AGENTS.md |
| Gemini/Cursor/API | deferred | — | `paw recall` | dedicated | GEMINI.md/— |

## Phase 0 findings (verified 2026-06-26)

- CC Stop stdin carries `transcript_path`; transcript = JSONL, assistant entries
  hold `message.content[].type==tool_use`, tool results ride user entries with
  `is_error` → fail→fix is parseable.
- CC events present: UserPromptSubmit, Stop, SessionStart, PostToolUse,
  PreToolUse, PostToolUseFailure.
- Codex events present: same set. **But Codex Stop→`portaw memory capture-hook`
  and SessionStart→`portaw memory session-hook` are DEAD (portaw)** — same
  migration gap as CC's mistake-learning stop-hook.
- **Residual risk:** Codex Stop stdin payload + transcript schema unverified
  (Codex mirrors the Claude hook contract, but the transcript JSONL shape must be
  confirmed before the capture adapter is trusted on Codex).

## Phases & sequencing

`0 verify → 1 recall-floor → 6 cleanup(migrate+retire) → 2 capture → 3 curate →
4 bench → 5 graduate`

| # | work | nah-blocked hook? |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | verify hook contracts (DONE for CC; Codex transcript TBV) | — |
| 1 | `paw recall <prompt>` CLI (wrap `router_block`) + read ICM + grep host committed file | — |
| 6 | migrate 46 `~/.paw/.../lessons.jsonl` → ICM (filter recurrence>1, drop raw-cmd noise); retire `~/.paw` overlay + dead mistake-learning stop-hook; fix CLAUDE.md single-source claim | hook = manual |
| 2 | **DONE (code+CLI; Stop-hook shim pending)** `paw/reflection.py` + `paw reflect --capture [--transcript] [--dry-run]` (reads Stop-hook stdin `{transcript_path,session_id}` else). Multi-signal scan → ICM `pending` topic + `type:` guess. **Noise control (owner's worry) — structural filters:** skip `is_error` that is permission-denial / `nah` guard (`_NON_ERROR`); skip `isCompactSummary`/`isMeta` turns; misalignment requires terse turn (≤240c) + strong marker only. Real-transcript validation: 5 raw → 1 after filters (4 FPs killed). `pending` excluded from `paw recall`. **Incremental capture:** CC Stop fires once per turn, so capture resumes from a per-session watermark (`~/.paw/state/reflect/<sid>.json`) — only new lines scanned, no cross-turn dup flood (`--full` forces rescan; dry-run never advances). Live-proven: run1 stores 1, run2 stores 0. | Stop-hook shim = manual |
| 3 | **DONE (engine+CLI; SessionStart shim pending)** `paw/curate.py` + `paw curate [--surface][--dry-run][--limit]`. Reconciles each pending vs `paw recall` top-K by Jaccard over summaries: **ADD** (no near-dup → store `mistakes`, seen:1, drops signal:/session:) · **BUMP** (Jaccard≥0.5 → increment existing `seen:N`, escalate seen≥3→critical, never downgrade) · **SKIP** (apply error). Drains pending (forget) on success. UPDATE-merge + DELETE deferred to Phase-4 LLM (heuristic text-rewrite = unsafe); `related_ids` deferred (no CLI flag). `--surface` = quiet-when-empty preview for SessionStart. Live-proven on canaries: j=0.90 bump (seen→2, medium→high) + add, pending drained, ICM restored. 16 curate tests, 138 total green. | SessionStart shim = manual |
| 4 | **DONE (scaffold + first signal; needs more fixtures)** `bench/_reflection_ab.py` — heuristic vs DeepSeek arms on a synthetic gold transcript (paraphrase-fair natural markers; 3 explicit mistakes + 1 silent-bug + 4 distractors). Result: both F1≈0.86 P=1.0 R=0.75, but heuristic 0.16ms/$0 vs DeepSeek 2141ms/$0.00025 and a **different miss** (heuristic blind to silent-bug; DeepSeek drops terse user correction). Verdict → decision #6 updated: heuristic default + LLM silent-bug pass (hybrid); pure-LLM not worth per-session cost. 6 bench-scoring tests. live-CC/live-Codex arms + multi-fixture stability = TODO. | — |
| 5 | suggest-graduate (`seen:N≥thr` + procedural-shape → flag candidate skill); periodic `icm consolidate` **⚠️ only with `--keep-originals` AND `--summarizer-provider <llm>`** (bare/provider=none JOINS the whole topic into one ' \| ' blob and DELETES originals — lossy, not summarization) | — |

## Open risks
- Codex Stop payload/transcript schema (Phase 0 residual) → gates Codex capture.
- DeepSeek API $ for reflection → bench before lock.
- Bench gold set needs hand-labeled transcripts.
