"""Session inject-log — one lesson injects ONCE per session (dedup across surfaces).

With multiple inject surfaces (SessionStart pins, prompt recall, tool-hook anchor/
error recall) the same lesson would otherwise re-inject every time it stays
relevant — pure context rot, the inject is already IN the conversation. This log
remembers what each session has seen. ``reset`` exists for SessionStart(compact):
compaction summarizes earlier injects away, so the slate is wiped and pins re-fire.

Tolerant by construction: any I/O error degrades to "nothing seen" (worst case a
duplicate inject, never a crash or a lost prompt). Files live under
~/.paw/session/<id>.json and are pruned after ``_TTL_DAYS``.

Dedup is PER-ID ttl, not whole-file: each id carries the timestamp it was injected,
and ``seen`` only counts ids marked within ``_DEDUP_TTL_S``. This bounds the log
(stale ids drop on the next write instead of accumulating for the file's whole
life) and means a lesson relevant again a day later CAN re-surface — the inject it
made earlier has long scrolled out of the live context, so re-showing it is help,
not rot. The legacy ``{"ids":[...]}`` shape still reads (folded in at file mtime).
