"""Router outcome ledger — did a suggestion actually get USED? (L2 feedback loop)

The router was fire-and-forget: it never learned that a suggestion kept being
ignored. This ledger counts, per capability set, how often it was suggested and
how often it converted (its `paw apply <set>` actually ran). A capability
suggested many times with zero conversions is DEMOTED: the router stops surfacing
it (noise) until evidence changes or the user resets it.

Same philosophy as the distrust overlay — evidence over static ranking — and the
same storage stance: machine-local jsonl, tolerant reads, store lock around
read-modify-write, every public call fail-safe (a broken ledger must never break
routing).
